# Talkdesk Challenge: Samuel Castro

This project is my take on the technical challenge given by Talkdesk, this are the requirements I will strive to achieve:

* Follow Uncle Bob's Clean Architecure (adapted to Golang's reality)
  * Some Domain-driven design concepts will be mixed in 
* Develop a *production ready* solution that is capable of data validation at scale
* Total test coverage using unit testing
